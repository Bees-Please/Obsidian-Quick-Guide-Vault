For those who do not know how to pull a repo in github:

1) In file explorer, find somewhere to make a new folder to perform your wizardry in (I'm doing it on my desktop)
2) Name the file something unique, open it, and copy the file path from the explorer adress bar
4) If you are on windows, press Win + R (If you are on Mac goodluck, if you are on Linux/Debian you do not need my help.) to bring up the run window

5) press enter to open up command prompt.
6) type `cd <directory you coppied>`, in my case the command would look like this:

8) Press enter, this will change your working directory into the file you created.
9) Type `git init` to initialize a blank repo
10) Type `git pull https://github.com/Bees-Please/Obsidian-Quick-Guide-Vault` to pull this parent repo into the folder.
*I'de like to note if you or the person you are pulling from is using their own repo with this guide, this instruction could be innacurate, please double check with whoever is providing this that this is infact the correct URL, I am not responsible for any damages you could incur downloading random peoples repositories.*

11) Go ahead and open the vault in obsidian, happy note taking!
